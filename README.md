# My TODO App

This app is able to add TODOs and track the number of total TODOs as 
well as the number of unchecked TODOs.

## Instructions
Open [index.html](/index.html) file on your computer into any browser. 
With the file open in your browser, you should see a `New TODO` button, 
use this button to create new TODOs. It also has delete functionality 
in the form of a button within each TODO that removes that TODO when 
clicked.
